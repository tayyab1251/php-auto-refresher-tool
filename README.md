## File Structure

No problem! Let’s clarify exactly where to place the license section in your README.md file.

Step-by-Step to Add the License Section
Open your README.md file in your text editor or IDE.

Scroll to the very bottom of the file. This is the best place to add the license information because it’s common to have it at the end of the README.

Add the license section right after the "File Structure" section. Here’s the layout to visualize where it should go:
